# Hello!
## a little message 

> I am completely sorry to announce this, but I am no longer updating the source code. I decided to go with a premium solution. I realize no one was really donating. No one was really caring about my well-being or anything else. I'm not going to work for free no more with any of my projects. It is a sad fact, but the open source community is kind of a dead waste of time. You'd rather get money than actually help someone knowing they're not going to help you when you fall. So, I just wanted to say that and get that off my chest. That's why I haven't been updating the source code or this GitHub repository. But you can always find it on Built by Bit. It's $15 and requires a license key. Anything can support me. I'll be happy. I am so sorry to those who actually were wanting something fully open source and constant updates. Don't get me wrong, the codebase will remain open source, but a lot of it has changed during the time of its full recode session, so, yeah.
